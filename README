Usage: $('#element_id').radioSelect( options, callback )

Options:  focusTimeout       - time until the expanded options disappear after losing focus;
                               false will define that there is no timeout at all and the box will not disappear
                               unless you click outside; default = 250
          matcherTimeout     - determines the delay the entered search terms are filtered on the last keyup
